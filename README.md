A small website that allows students to give anonymous real time feedback about the speed of the class. This should lower the threshold to ask for help if students don't understand something or if the lecture is too slow.

Developped during the 2022 Hack and Harvest Hackathon.

Plug and play, download the files, insert the login data for your MySQLi DataBase in CONFIG.php and start.
